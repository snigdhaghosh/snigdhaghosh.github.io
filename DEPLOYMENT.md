## 🔄 Future Updates

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
1. Make changes to your React code in the `frontend/` directory
2. Commit and push to the `master` branch
3. GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy

### Manual Development
For local development and testing:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
The site will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

All deployment is now handled automatically by GitHub Actions.

## 🛠️ Local Development

To run the website locally for development:

```bash

```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## 📝 Notes

1. **GitHub Pages Propagation**: Changes may take 5-10 minutes to appear on the live site
2. **HTTPS**: GitHub Pages automatically provides HTTPS
3. **Custom Domain**: You can add a custom domain later if needed
4. **Analytics**: PostHog analytics are already configured
5. **SEO**: Meta tags and descriptions are optimized

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If the site doesn't load:
1. **Check GitHub Actions**: Go to Actions tab in your repository and verify the workflow completed successfully
2. **GitHub Pages Settings**: Go to Settings > Pages and ensure:
   - Source is set to "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch is set to "gh-pages" (this will be created automatically)
3. **Wait for propagation**: Changes may take 5-10 minutes to appear
4. **Check the gh-pages branch**: A new `gh-pages` branch should be created automatically with your built files

If deployment fails:
1. **Check workflow logs**: Click on the failed workflow in the Actions tab
2. **Repository permissions**: Ensure the repository has Actions enabled (Settings > Actions > General)
3. **GitHub Token**: The workflow uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` which is automatically provided
4. **Branch protection**: Ensure `master` branch allows Actions to push

## 📞 Support

For any issues with the deployment:
1. Check GitHub Actions logs in your repository
2. Verify the build process completed successfully
3. Contact support if needed
